## Formatting outputs
The %'s are `Format Specifier`'s and are used to format strings with data from variables concatenated in between in a fancy waY. Here are a few common ones

| Format Specifier | Used to format...                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| %d               | Integers (***D***ecimal)            |
| %s               | ***S***trings                       |
| %f               | ***F***loats                        |
| %p               | ***P***ointers (as hexadecimal)     |
| %ld              | Longs ("***L***ong ***D***ecimals") |
| %lf              | Doubles ("***L***ong ***F***loats") |


#todo what are the % sequences called? Is there a name for them?
