> "Abstract Data Types are a fundamental component of problem solving in computer science – they allow you to think in terms of how data is organized, and what operations can be performed on that data – so you can determine what is the optimal way to store and manage the information for any specific problem you need to solve - without having to worry about implementation details."

^^From Paco's notes^^

We call some data types ADT's because we are not specifying how it's being implemented (because there are many ways to do that!)
This bit of semantics is important because, no matter what implementation or language you are using, the base behavior should be the same

Some examples are
- [[Lists|List ADTs]]
- Queue ADT's
	- Enqueuing and Dequeuing
