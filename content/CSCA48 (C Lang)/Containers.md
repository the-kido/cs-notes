A container is a construct (something we have built) that provides a means for storing, organizing, and accessing a **collection** of data items of a given type.

Some examples include
- [[CSCA48 (C Lang)/Arrays|Arrays]]
	- Very simple; very limited
- [[Lists]]

#### Collections
-  A *set* of data / items
	- I.e. Netflix is a set/collection of movies
- Manageable
	- Somehow efficiently manageable, useable, and easy to maintain.
- Usually the elements are unique
