A [[Containers|container]] that stores data in some sequential order. 
### List [[Abstract Data Types (ADT)|Abstract Data Type]] 
Some common behavior for lists are
- Creating a list
- Adding data
- Removing data
- Looking up an item

One implementation of the List ADT are [[Linked Lists]]!

>[!note] Unlike just describing a "list" as a thing that stores data sequentially, the List ADT specifies the "operations" that allows it to fulfil that behavior
