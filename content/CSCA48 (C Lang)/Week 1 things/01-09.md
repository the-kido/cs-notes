[[Running Code]]
[[printf]] goes over formatting prints

When declaring a variable w/o a set value (like when declaring `int x;`), it will take whatever value the 'x' takes up. "JUNK" values as he calls it.
```c
int i; // This could assume 0, 1290139, or -1. Anything depending on RAM's graveyard.
```

[[Good Practice and BAD Practice]]

`mod` does not work on floats. int only. Use fmod() instead (that'll mod floats and/or ints). Inside of `math.h`

#todo and i assume paco will explain this more but this seems interesting and pretty important. 
Floats do a balancing act between the int and rational components. if the int part is very large, it'll have no more storage to deal with decimals. effectively it's like it becomes an integer.
