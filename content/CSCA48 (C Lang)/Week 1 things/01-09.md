[[Running Code]]

[[printf]] goes over formatting prints

When declaring a variable w/o a set value (like when declaring `int x;`), it will take whatever value the 'x' takes up. "JUNK" values as he calls it.
```c
int i; // This could assume 0, 1290139, or -1. Anything depending on RAM's graveyard.
```

[[Variables]]



#### bad practice
- declaring variables wherever I need them.
	- it's a mess
	- you should have your solution before you actually start coding.
		- with c, you gotta plan!

Case study:
char c = 'C'
char c = "C" // This will not work. pointer stuff yknow. it'll try to shoehorn the pointer (the address) into a character.
#todo check if it runs or nah

```c
int x = 10;
printf("%c", x); // Just because the data types don't match it will still run. it'll make due with whatever data is stored at 'x' in RAM and interpret that as a character. 
```

mod does not work on floats. int only.  Use fmod() instead (that'll mod floats and/or ints). Inside of `math.h`

Floats do a balancing act between the int and rational components. if the int part is very large, it'll have no more storage to deal with decimals. effectively it's like it becomes an integer.

break exists a loop.
