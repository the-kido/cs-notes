`main` is where le program starts in some c program.

He specifies 3 steps to run code:
1. edit your program in some text editor and saved as text
	1. We save of ofc
2. We *compile* the code. 
	1. translates code into machine language w/ simple instructions
	2. interpreted languages are translated in *real time*! compiled languages do it in 1 go.
	3. specific data types are important as the cpu needs to know how to deal with them. i.e. storing an int is dealt with by some circuit while floats are dealt with by another circuit
`./` refers to the current directory. On windows is `.\`
