for loops can use any data type you can increment

"no style requierd in csca48". paco the goat for real

### functions yay

returnType name (args)
{
	// things
	return valueOfReturnType;
}
args are each "dataType" "name", ~~


void = no return type ye
Useful for
- wasting time (lol)
- changing global variables
- Pritning something


'none' is sitll an object in python. void is nothing. 
replace all args with 'void' that takes in nothing.

You gotta declare functions before using them. Unless you specify the signature abv like in cs50.
### `Collatz Conjecture`
f(i) 
1. i % 2 == 0 --> f(i) = i/2
2. otherwise f(i) = 3i + 1

repeating this function 
Any number you pass will return 1 eventually.
There is NO proof!? But it seems to be right.

We write a program that does this. yippee
