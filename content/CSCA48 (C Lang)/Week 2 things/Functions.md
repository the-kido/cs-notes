The format of a function looks like of like this:

```c
returnType name (args)
{
	// things
	return valueOfReturnType;
}
args are each "dataType" "name", ~~
```

`void` = no return type ye
Useful for
- wasting time (lol)
- changing global variables
- Pritning something

`None` is still an object in python. void is literally nothing. 
replace all args with 'void' that takes in nothing.

You gotta declare functions before using them. Unless you specify the signature abv like in cs50.

#todo clear this out and move to [[CSCA48 (C Lang)/Functions|Functions]]
