pointers
- a memory address where data is
- it's a variable (it has its own box)
- NULL = pointer is not assigned
- &x --> "get the address of x"

```c
int a = 10;
int* pointer = NULL;
// Fetch data from a pointer
printf("%d", *pointer);
// Update the value of the variable the opinter is pointing to.
*pointer = 20; //  Reads as "let's access the box pointed to and assign it something"
```

So there are two instances of `*`  being used
1. When creating a pointer
2. When accessing the variable / box being pointed to.

He uses parenthesis because it makes wacky lines clearer.
```c
int x = 5;
int* p = &x;

*(p) = *p * *p; // This is real.

*(p) = (*(p)) * (*(p)); // This is real.

```

pointers can point to data with other data types. the compiler will warn you (?) but at this point the compiler is not your friend. it assumes you are a pointer expert.

What happens if you do this?
```c
int* a = NULL;
a* = 10;
```
Ans: segfault, as NULL is a pointer reserved by the system. Of course, you should not be able to change it so that's a segfault for you,


Lecture example yayay
```c
void changePizza(int *p)
{
	*p = *p + 2;
	*(p+2)=*(p-2);
	*(p+1)= -*(p+1);
	(*(p-3))++;
	*(p+3) = 5;

}

int main()
{
	int my_pizza  = 1;
	int *p = NULL;

	int group_pizzas[10];

	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) group_pizzas[i] = i % 5;
	
	p = &group_pizzas[5];
	changePizza(p);
	for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) printf("Pizza %d is %d\n", i, group_pizzas[i]);
}
```
#todo analyse this more. maybe make this a question paco could defo give.
Memory:
main:
1. 6-->my_pizza: int = 1
2. 7-->p: int* = NULL
3. 8-->`<return>` = junk
4. changePizza
	1. 9-->p: int* = 0x6
#todo if returning void does it return anything / do we make the memory box
ans: NO box if returning void.
