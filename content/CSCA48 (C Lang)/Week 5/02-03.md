# pacflix
The items we are storing are movies/shorts/shows/etc.
And, they each need
- char title[1024]
- float rating
- float length # in minutes sure.
- int year
- char genre [1024]
- `int poster[384][384]` (an image as a 2d array!?)
- int age_rating

to implement this data, we would need a seperate array for each of the above "fields" and it would look pretty ugly.
- it'll be a pain to delete a movie
- hard to add new movies (especially since the size of arrays are constant)

We wanna bundle the fields together. duct tape yes. via Compound Data Types (CDT)

```c
//typedef defines a new type.
// struct means it's a compound data type (many fields inside)
// show_struct is an alias for the data type
typedef struct show_struct{
	char title[1024];
	float rating;
	int year char genre[1024];
	int poster[384][384];
	int age_rating;
} PacoType; 
// PacoType = struct show_struct
// They are totally equivalent

int main()
{
	PacoType one_paco;
	one_paco.rating = 5.0;
	onePaco.year = 1999;
	one_paco.age_rating = 5;
	
	// one_oaco.title = "Very Nice Family Show" is NOT allowed 
	strcpy(one_paco.title, "Veyr nice family show!");
	strcpy(one_paco.genre, "Family");
	
	return 0;	
}

```
The memory model looks like this:
707 --> onePaco: PacoType = junk.
708 --> `return` = 0

Note how PacoType is just 1 box.
