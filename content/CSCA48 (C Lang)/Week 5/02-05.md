```c
typedef struct thing 
{
	int x;
	int y;
	char bazinga[];
}

int main()
{
	x = y; // will copy EVERYTHing from y into x.
	// However for the string it would just copy the address. it does not copy the 
}
```

#todo can you have functions that use a data type above the actual declaration of the struct.

He says you should use the -> arrow notation instead of just dereferencing and using the `.` syntax as good practice. no real other reason. Semantically `->` just makes more sense.

Always sanitize input (i.e. if the input is wrong then ask for it again)


### linked lists
We hate arrays. they suck. we want a sized array that is dynamic. 
- we want it to shrink/increase in size depending on the size of collection.
- We can remove items from any spots
- They are ordered sequentially
	- you can search thru them.

Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- We don't care abt the language or specific implementation.
- it's the properties of how data is organized and the operations that are possible
- Written in English or pssudo code

## Tutorial
`*` = "contents of "
`&` = "address of"

```c
float x = 2.5;
int *y = &((int) x); // Is this allowed?
```

```c
int *y = &(1 + 1);
// This isn't allowed as & needs an "lvalue" 
```
an `lvalue` is  an object that has an identifiable location in memory

`++` has highest priority 
So doing `p++  eqv *(p++)`

`*(p)++` gets the value first, then increments by 1. So it does nothing. 

`++p*` is not allowed. lol the `*`  
`
```
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int *p = &x;

// equivalent to ++(*p)
++*p;

// x is 6
// y is 10
// p points to x.
```

#todo WHAT
#### 2d arrays yeyeyeye
```c
int array_2d[2][3]; // 2 rows and 3 columns.
```
- In memory it's read left to right line by line

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D   | E   | F   |
In memory would just be A, B, C, D, E, F. 
I think you could technically do something like
```c
int arr[2][3];

*(arr+3) = 4; // This would be the second row, first column!? !?!?!?
```

#todo Note down the matrix offset formula (or offset formula for any 2d array.)
