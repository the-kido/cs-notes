Java code is ran via the JVM, which:
1. Uses its [[Interpreter]] to read the byte-code given by the [[Java Compiler]]
2. Runs its JIT compiler for optimization optionally
3. Runs the code for every device. 

> Therefore, Java is kind of *both* interpreted and compiled, but not* fully* interpreted and not *fully* compiled
