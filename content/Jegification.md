Indent using this format

# 2 Header
The header will be like this:
```java
/**
Author:
Date:
Description:
**/
```
# 3 No commented-out code
Do not submit code with the backslashes (or it should run with the backslashes on lines)

# 4 Pretty math
Add spaces between all of arithmetic 
```java
int value = (x + 6) / 4
```


# 5 Variable names
All variable names need to have the data type before them
```java
int intValue = 10;
double dblValue = 2.5;

String strPain = "Welcome to jegified land";


```

# 6 Comment everything
Always describe what a variable does when you declare it (EVERY ONE); don't just say you declared it
```java
// intJohn is an integer variable to store John's age
int intJohn;
```


# 7 Scanner will always be called "input"
