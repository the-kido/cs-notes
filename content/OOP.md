An object is user-defined data type (?)

An object consists of
* Attributes (Instance variables). Ways to describe the object, i guess. These are "instance variables"
	* int, double, strings, etc
	* data structures can also be attributes
	* They can also be other objects
* Actions (Methods)
	*  Things you can do with the object

>[!Note] Instance variables are fields, but not all fields are instance variables
>- A field can be static. Instance variables cannot. 
>- Instance variables are bound solely to the object
### Purpose of OOP
- To make objects for use cases. I.e. a "Point" object which has the attributes x and y could have methods to
	- Translate
	- Reflect
	- Find the distance to another point
	- Find the slope of two points
	- Etc.

Concepts:
- Encapsulation
