It could be stored permanently on a server or something

What is a variable?
- A memory location in the RAM
- Do not fly on the Boeing 373 max 

Data types 
- Memory management:
	-  Smallest unit is a bit (0 or 1)
	- 1 Byte is 8 bits
	- 1024 bytes in 1 kilobyte
	- 1024 kilobyte in 1 megabyte
	- etc.

Primitive types (values with a `?` are wrong but Jeg said so)

| ------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| integer | 4 bytes   | integers (-1, 0, 1, etc.) |
| double  | 8 bytes   | Real numbers              |
| float   | 4 bytes   | Real numbers              |
| String  | 32 bytes? | all characters            |
| Char    | 1 byte?   | single letter             |
| bool    | 1 byte    | true, false               |
